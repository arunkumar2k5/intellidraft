design_considerations:
  input_voltage:
    tolerance: ±5%
    note: "Taken from the regulator supply input for sample version assumption."

  load_current:
    tolerance: ±5%
    note: "To be defined as per camera system requirement."

  output_voltage:
    tolerance: ±5%
    note: "To be defined as per camera system requirement."

  resistor_tolerance:
    factors:
      - temperature_drift
      - aging
      - manufacturing_tolerance
    note: "Overall tolerance includes combined effects of temperature, aging, and production spread."

  capacitor_tolerance:
    factors:
      - temperature_drift
      - aging
      - manufacturing_tolerance
    note: "Includes drift and degradation due to temperature and aging."

  power_design:
    camera_consumption:
      typical: 165mA
      maximum_design: 210mA
      note: "Designed for 210mA max to ensure margin over expected 165mA camera load."

  thermal_conditions:
    ambient_temperature_max: 85°C
    board_temperature_max: 100°C
    margin_added: 15°C
    note: "15°C added to account for on-board thermal rise above ambient."

  resistor_derating:
    factor: 0.6
    reason: "Derating by 60% for power dissipation based on 100°C board temperature."

  temperature_dependency:
    note: "Pull-up and pull-down internal resistor values are calculated without temperature variation graph data."
